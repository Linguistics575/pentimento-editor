This repository contains code to host the site https://linguistics575.github.io/pentimento-editor/

This website is for editing the output of OCR text (text automatically transcribed via software) in order to produce an accurate transcription of a book.

# Getting started

In order to view and edit the website, you need to sign in with your github account. If you don't have a github account, please sign up here: https://github.com/

When you first navigate to https://linguistics575.github.io/pentimento-editor/, there will be a popup for sign-in. Please tell your browser to allow popups if it blocks the popup.

# How to edit a book

## How the interface works

You can view one page at a time from a specific book. The original image is on the right side, and the text transcription is on the left side. Originally, the transcription is automatically done by a computer, but there's always mistakes present when we use this method. Areas of high confidence are colored black, areas of medium confidence are colored blue, and areas of low confidence are colored red. This color scheme is meant to aid the proofreading process, but it is not perfect. There can be an error anywhere!

You can edit the colors via the A symbol at the top of the text editor. When doing so, please follow the black-blue-red scheme discussed here. Note that colors are used in this interface only, and will be removed automatically once you are done with the project and download your book as text files. 

The interface has a 'read out loud' feature which may make it easier for you to quickly proofread a page.

When you click save, your work for the current page will be saved. Anyone should be able to see your changes afterwards.

## Text format standards

You should check with your project supervisor on specific requirements for your project, but a good place to start is by checking out "Key help documents" of Distributed Proofreaders (Project Gutenberg's tool): https://www.pgdp.net/
